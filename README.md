FishHunter game
Xianghui Huang
How to run:
1,download the unity Remote 5 on iPhone
2,connect the iPhone to PC
3,On Unity PC platform click the file->build setting -> select the iOS -> build and run
4.have fun on the Game!!!!


Note: the screen is not really suit for the phone when I made this game into the iPhone, so when the gun shooting the fish, sometimes it is not working, I still trying to fix this problem until the time when I submitting this project. I think the reason is I downloaded the pictures and the demo for the PC version, So when I making the iPhone version there is some conflicts between the code and the picture. Learn a lot of stuffs during the time when I using the Unity, like how to set the main camera and how to use the library like collision box or Trigger 2D on the Unity to make two objects do some functions. But all in all It was really fun.
